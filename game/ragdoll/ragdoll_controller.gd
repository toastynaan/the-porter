class_name RagdollController
extends Node
## Ported from big-kick (scripts/fighter/ragdoll_controller.gd). Its notes on agents, rounds,
## Fighter, Carry and combat describe big-kick; the code here only needs a
## host like Zombie (see game/ragdoll/host/zombie.gd).
##
## Ragdoll state machine (spec: Ragdoll system > States) plus the per-bone
## torque loop (soft limits, neutral tension, muscles) run from ONE
## _physics_process per character through PhysicsServer3D RIDs.
## OWNER: agent A (rig & ragdoll). CONTRACT STUB: keep every public signature.
##
## Pose and host:
## - This node writes the skeleton pose every physics tick
##   (process_physics_priority -10: after PoseAnimator at -20, before the
##   Fighter at 0).
## - Host contract: the host has a direct child CollisionShape3D "Capsule".
##   In full simulation (LAUNCHED, GROUNDED, DEAD, held) the capsule is
##   disabled, the rig is set top_level so moving the host never drags the
##   bones, and the host is moved every tick to the pelvis XZ on the floor
##   (so host.global_position == get_ground_position()). On get-up the host is
##   teleported to the pelvis, turned to face the get-up direction, the rig is
##   re-parented to it and the capsule re-enabled.
## - FLINCH and STAGGER (stagger and stumble) keep the capsule; this node moves
##   the host with the reaction's push through host.move_and_slide() and feeds
##   that motion to the animator's locomotion (the stumble steps). The Fighter
##   must not call move_and_slide while is_simulating().
##
## Round 5 partial ragdolls (Feel Reference: Partial ragdoll reactions):
## - Per-bone muscle strength. limp_chain() hands a chain of bones to physics:
##   strength = 1 - physics_amount, fading back to 1. Only the chain bones and
##   their descendants simulate (the descendants at full strength, shown with
##   their animated local rotation); every other bone is kinematic and tracks
##   the animation exactly. get_bone_strength() reports it. A chain bone shows
##   its physics pose until its physics share drops under CHAIN_BLEND_OUT,
##   then crossfades back to the animation, so nothing pops.
## - limp_chain() on a standing fighter keeps state ANIMATED: the fighter keeps
##   moving and attacking with, say, one limp arm.
## - Reactions by tier (Tuning.REACT_*): flinch() = the hit chain only
##   (hit_chain()); stumble() = the hit leg from the knee down + side steps;
##   stagger() = spine and up + both arms, legs animated, pushed back, never
##   tips into a launch; knockdown() = full body, low tone, drops in place;
##   launch() = full body, very low tone, limb spin. Stumbles use State.STAGGER
##   (get_reaction_kind() tells them apart).
## - Ground time before the get-up: set_getup_after(s) (any time before or
##   during the knockdown / launch; it wins over the default), else a random
##   value in the tier's Tuning.REACT_*.ground range, counted from the first
##   floor contact. The player uses Tuning.PLAYER_GETUP_AFTER counted from the
##   hit, and a fast get-up (GETUP_TIMES_FAST).
##
## Contact frame and hitstop (B and H rely on this):
## - Every tick this node polls host.is_frozen() (the Fighter's hitstop) and
##   honours freeze(). While frozen, every simulating bone is HELD: its
##   velocity is stashed and zeroed, gravity is off, torques and reaction
##   timers stop, and the visual jitters 2-4 cm (Tuning.HITSTOP_JITTER_RANGE)
##   when the hold began with a reaction. When the freeze ends the stashed
##   velocities come back and gravity returns.
## - Animation history (the last two animated poses, from which every bone's
##   starting velocity is taken) is never recorded while the host is frozen,
##   so the cache always holds the last two poses BEFORE the freeze (a frozen
##   animation would give zero).
## - Reactions apply at once: the state changes immediately, each newly
##   simulated bone starts with its cached animation velocity plus the
##   reaction impulse. During a hold those velocities go into the stash.
## - So the call order does not matter. Reaction then TimeDirector.hitstop()
##   in the same frame, hitstop then reaction, or a reaction during the
##   freeze: the victim holds its contact pose for the freeze, then moves off
##   with cached animation velocity + impulse. (If one physics step ran
##   between the reaction and the start of the hold, the bodies are put back
##   to their contact transforms.)
## - A limb severed during the hold waits frozen at the stump and flies off
##   with the bone's stashed velocity when the hold ends; a limb severed in the
##   same frame just before a launch() also gets that launch's velocity.
##
## Bodies stay (Round 5): on kill() the bones move to Layers.DEAD_BODY /
## MASK_DEAD_BODY (walking capsules ignore them). A dead body freezes into
## static colliders after Tuning.DEAD_FREEZE_AFTER s at rest (sooner when more
## than DEAD_AWAKE_MAX corpses are awake); a frozen body costs nothing (this
## node stops processing; a dead body's animator stops at death). wake() /
## nudge() / begin_held() / launch() / add_velocity() unfreeze it; it
## refreezes after DEAD_REFREEZE_AFTER s at rest.
##
## Held bodies (Round 5, Carry): begin_held() pins a bone to a hand node with
## a velocity motor (strong but force-limited, so walls stop it instead of
## snagging), the rest dangles with low tone (a live body struggles weakly in
## the "held" pose, a dead one is limp), bones are capped at 18 m/s and the
## held body never collides with the holder.
